# üß† Topology & TDA Learning Repo

This repository documents my self-guided journey through **Topology** and **Computational Topology for Data Analysis (TDA)** ‚Äî a bridge between abstract mathematics and modern data science. It is based primarily on:

- *Topology* by James Munkres (1st half)
- *Computational Topology for Data Analysis* by Tamal Krishna Dey and Yusu Wang

My goal is to strengthen my foundation in mathematical topology, gain practical insight into TDA methods, and prepare for future research or internship opportunities in mathematics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why This Repo?

- To organize my learning and track progress
- To produce output I can share in applications for internships and research opportunities
- To help others coming from a CS background transition into pure/applied math
